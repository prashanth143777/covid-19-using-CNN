Detection And Classification Of COVID-19 Using CNN


The novel coronavirus(COVID-19) with a starting point at china, has spread over the other countries and is approximately 305,275 cases in world wide according to the statistics of European Center for Disease prevention control . The COVID-19 cases was increases day by day the hospitals have only limited number of COVID-19 test kits therefore it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as quick diagnosis and given better prescription to patients This study will helps us to detecting and classification of COVID-19 patients to prevent the spread of the diseases to other people The image segmentation and neural network are used for automatic detection and classification of COVID-19 It takes the image as input and apply techniques to that image like preprocessing segmentation and then the input is given to the convolution neural network in order to classify the diseases
